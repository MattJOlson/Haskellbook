# Algebraic data types and kinds

## Type ctors vs data ctors

- types are static, so type ctors evaluate at compile time
- data ctors evaluate at runtime, at term level

Type ctors without args are "type constants" (eg `Bool`)

Type ctors appear before the `=` in a datatype def'n, data ctors after
- When data ctors take params, those refer to other types
- (possibly parametric, possibly unconstrained)

## Kinds, part 1

Kind `*` is a concrete type, kind `* -> *` is a type ctor waiting to be
applied.

## Arity

Data constructors that take more than one type (arity higher than 1) are
product types (so they're going to admit projections, bifunctors, all
that good stuff)

## Cardinality

Cardinality of a datatype -> number of values it defines (i.e.
cardinality of its set in *Hask*.) Can be 0 for `void` or infinite e.g.
for lists.

## Newtype

`newtype` declarations can only ever have a single unary data ctor,
unlike `data` declarations. So no product types, no sum types, no
nullary (constant) types. The cardinality of a `newtype` is the same as
that of the type it contains.

### y tho
- No runtime overhead, reuses representation of the type it contains
- Simple way to narrow a platform type like `Integer` into a
  domain-specific one
- Unlike a type synonym, you can define new typeclasses for `newtype`s
  -- stuff that isn't contained in the base type

(Skimming the stuff about `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` but I guess I
should know it's there.)

## Record syntax

```
data Person = 
    Person {
        name :: String,
        age :: Int
    } deriving (Eq, Show)
```
